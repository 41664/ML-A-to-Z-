# Machine Learning A to Z

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks that contain Python code and some more notes for all modules of the course by Kirill Eremenko , Hadelin de Ponteves and the SUperDataScience Team. I will try to make it more and more comprehensive and information rich as we go along. 

### Note-
I'm not the owner of any of the data sets that are available in this code. ALl the datasets are owned and hosted by the SuperDataScience Team.
